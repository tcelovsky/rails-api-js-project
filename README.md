# Rails API with Javascript Project

This is a single page web app that allows a user to create multiple lists and add items to those lists. For example, a user may create To Do list, Grocery Shopping list, Travel Destinations list, etc. A user is able to add and delete the items on each list. A user is also able to create and delete the lists.

This app is be built using Rails API for the backend and JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the frontend. Rails API was created with Postgres database, instead of the default SQLite3.

Start Rails server by entering `rails s` in your terminal. Open index.html in the browser to use the app. A custome Rake command `rake db:dcms` will drop, create, migrate and seed the database with seed data.
