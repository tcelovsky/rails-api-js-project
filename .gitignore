# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

*.gem
*.rbc

backend/InstalledFiles
backend/pkg/
backend/spec/reports/
backend/spec/examples.txt
